 * @brief This file contains the custom footer for the documentation site.
 *
 * This file is included in the footer of the documentation site.
 * It contains custom JavaScript code that is executed on every page load.
 *
 * This script supports the use of dark themes on the documentation site.
 *
 * Invert images (except those with the 'no-invert' class) to match the theme.
 *
 * - The docs use some SVG images that draw black on transparent background,
 *   making them black-on-black in the dark themes.
 *
 * - Other black-on-white drawings are inverted to white-on-black to match
 *   the dark theme as well. This is also more friendly to dark theme users.
 *
 * - The "invert" filter used is set to use 85% strength:
 *   With it, the image background will be medium dark grey, carefully
 *   matching the background colour of the page body in the dark themes.
 *
 * Other images:
 * - The xapi-project logo embedded in the menu is correctly not changed.
 * - The output image from `lstopo` also looks better inverted in the dark theme.
 * - Adding the class `no-invert` to an image will prevent it from being inverted.
